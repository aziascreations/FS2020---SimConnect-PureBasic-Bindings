# FS2020 - SimConnect PureBasic Bindings

A simple includes that provides bindings to a couple of the functions and structures present in the SimConnect API.

Only a very small set of the structs and functions are finished and have been tested, use at your own risk.


## Usage


## Building

### Dynamically linked apps

Just place the dll file present in the SDK in the same folder as your final or temporary executable.


### Statically linked apps

You might be able to do it, I don't know how, the compiler just kept barfing up symbol errors on my side.
